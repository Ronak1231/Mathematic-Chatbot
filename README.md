# Math Chatbot 🤖

Welcome to **Math Chatbot**, your go-to tool for performing mathematical calculations, unit conversions, and visualizing functions. Whether you're a student, engineer, or math enthusiast, this chatbot will help you solve your problems with ease.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Arithmetic Operations**
- Perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Supports complex numbers (e.g., `2+3j`).

### 2. **Variable Assignments**
- Assign variables with expressions (e.g., `x = 2 + 3`).
- Reuse variables in subsequent calculations.

### 3. **Unit Conversions**
- Convert between popular units:
  - Meters ↔️ Kilometers
  - Miles ↔️ Kilometers
  - Celsius ↔️ Fahrenheit
  - Inches ↔️ Meters
  - Miles per Hour ↔️ Meters per Second
  - Calories ↔️ Joules

### 4. **Plot Mathematical Functions**
- Plot any valid mathematical function with ease.
- Example: `plot sin(x)` generates a plot of the sine function.

### 5. **Calculation History**
- Track and display a history of your calculations for easy reference.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input Expressions:**
   - Enter arithmetic expressions directly (e.g., `2 + 3`).
   - Assign variables (e.g., `a = 5`).
   - Convert units (e.g., `100 meters to kilometers`).

2. **Plotting Functions:**
   - Use the `plot` keyword followed by the function (e.g., `plot x**2`).

3. **Error Handling:**
   - The chatbot provides suggestions for invalid input and highlights errors.
