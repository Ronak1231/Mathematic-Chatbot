# Math Chatbot ðŸ¤–

This is an interactive Math Chatbot application built using Streamlit. The chatbot allows users to:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Evaluate mathematical expressions.
- Perform unit conversions.
- Plot mathematical functions.
- Assign and use variables in expressions.
- View calculation history.

## Features

### 1. **Arithmetic and Mathematical Functions**
- Perform basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Evaluate functions like `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `exp`.
- Use complex numbers in calculations.

### 2. **Variable Assignment**
- Assign values to variables for reuse in expressions, e.g., `x = 5`.

### 3. **Unit Conversions**
- Convert between units like:
  - Meters to kilometers
  - Miles to kilometers
  - Celsius to Fahrenheit
  - Inches to meters
  - Miles per hour to meters per second
  - Calories to joules

### 4. **Function Plotting**
- Plot mathematical functions, e.g., `sin(x)` or `x**2 + 3`.

### 5. **Calculation History**
- Automatically saves and displays a history of calculations performed during the session.

### 6. **Error Handling**
- Detects undefined variables and suggests corrections for common typos.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Install required packages with:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
